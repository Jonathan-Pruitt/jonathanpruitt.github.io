				<h1>About me</h1>
			</header>
			<div class="prose">
				<span>For the first decade of my career I worked in various movie theaters.</span>
				<span>In 2016, I began working for the banking industry as an assistant branch manager.</span>
				<span>During the summer of 2020, while we were in the midst of Covid-19, I met Audra.</span>
				<span>2 years later I moved an hour west to Biloxi, MS to be with her.</span>
				<span>Around this time, I took an interest in learning to code. I had always been a computer person, but never learned coding.</span>
				<span>I joined on with Mississippi Coding Academies, and have been working towards full-stack development certification.</span>
