				<h1>About me</h1>
			</header>
			<div class="prose">
				<p>For the first decade of my career I worked in various movie theaters.</p>
				<p>In 2016, I began working for the banking industry as an assistant branch manager.</p>
				<p>During the summer of 2020, while we were in the midst of Covid-19, I met Audra.</p>
				<p>2 years later I moved an hour west to Biloxi, MS to be with her.</p>
				<p>Around this time, I took an interest in learning to code. I had always been a computer person, but never learned coding.</p>
				<p>I joined on with Mississippi Coding Academies, and have been working towards full-stack development certification.</p>
