				<h1>About me</h1>
			</header>
			<div class="prose">
				<p>For the first decade of my career, I worked in the movie theater industry as an employee and manager in the Daphne/Mobile area. In 2016, I began working in the banking industry as an assistant manager.</p>
				<p>During the summer of 2020, while we were in the midst of Covid-19, I met my now wife, Audra. After 2 years, in 2022, I moved from Mobile AL, to Biloxi MS to be with her. While in Biloxi, I found the Mississippi Coding Academies which offered the educational opportunity to learn full-stack development/programming.</p>
				<p>In 2023, I married Audra, completed my training with MCA, and received my CompTIA Security+ certification. Since that time, I have been working with MCA as an assistant instructor and working on passion projects like the Catan Tracker application seen above.</p>
